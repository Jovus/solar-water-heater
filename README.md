RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the SolarWaterHeater.py file however you like to open Python files (either commandline with python3.py or through the IDLE or other development environment of choice) and run like any other python file. Make sure to run from the base directory. Requires Python3 and for the matplotlib package to be installed. Developed in Python 3.9.6, on Arch Linux 5.13.4

On Windows, matplotlib *may* require Anaconda to run; I am unfamiliar with Windows scipy/numpy support.

The accompanying configuration file, swh.ini, is currently configured with 'all options' on. Instructions for changing configuration values are in the ini itself.
